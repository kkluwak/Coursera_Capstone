    "Prices of flats in Poland go up faster than inflation, according to the report of money.pl website. Rising apartment prices on the market effectively obscure another problem - the increase in rental prices. This trend affects students, young workers without their own flats or economic immigrants. According to the analysis of experts at Rynekpotny.pl, the increases reached even 23%. Despite everything, life in Warsaw tempts many young people."

    "The capital is mainly attracting to itself those who are focused on making dizzying careers or artists and creative people. The heart of the city is the City Centre, which is vibrant with life at any time of day or night. It is one of eighteen districts, but each of them has different advantages. In this scenario, machine learning tools should be used to assist people coming to Warsaw to make wise and effective decisions. As a result, the business problem is: how can we help people moving to the capital to choose the right flat in Warsaw?\n",

    "In order to solve this business problem, we intend to merge Warsaw districts into a cluster in order to recommend facilities. We will recommend facilities according to the amenities and necessary equipment of the surrounding facilities, i.e. primary schools, high schools, hospitals and grocery stores."
